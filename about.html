<p class="intro" title="About" style="text-align:left; "><img src="images/img5.png" style="float:right"width="400" height="300"><cite > Monexp </cite> is a small private organisation which serves various services to the community like Web Developemnet,App Developemnet ,Database Management and lot others.We all know the fundamental behind having a strong virtual presence of an organization on World Wide Web. We are familiar with many day-to-day internet-related terminologies, technology-driven apps, and marketing-gripped social media forums. We have heard some interesting stories of companies that flourished also because they didn't ignored the power of electronic business! Yet, when it comes to the establishment of an own undertaking, a new venture of any kind, we first keep its online profiling as a last resort! Isn't it surprising?<br><br><br>Along with the paramount command of ASP.NET, Ext JS, SQL Server, MySQL, CakePHP, SEO/SEM, and Web-Designing on our side, we are growing stronger each day, which ultimately helps us to bring about this phenomenal change ever more convincingly. From our head office cum atelier in the highly developed Manipal University Jaipur, we are a 24X7 functional body active towards building a number of hard-hitting, AI-oriented web architectures as well as interfaces for our clients. After intensive brainstorming upon the methodological difficulties creating serious hardware/software work interruptions, we provide customized solutions only. We integrate results, if necessary, so as to decipher the root cause of entrepreneurial failure. Our conceptual but concrete work is the reason why you can trust us.</p>
